Goals: 	
	Get bluetooth to work for all machines
	Do this week's exercises

Results:
	Getting bluetooth to work in linux mint:
		install package libbluetooth-dev
		connect using "bluez-simple-agent hci# [address]
		nxjbrowse now works

	Exercise 1 (with floodlight):
		red		60
		blue 	44
		grey	54
		dark green 40
		light green 51
		white	63
		black	35
		(first three results taken in one lighting condition on semi-glossy paper, last four in another on matte felt)
		It's interesting to note that the color red is registered almost as bright as white, which is due to the color of the floodlight.
		By measuring black and white you get the upper and lower bounds on light levels, and finding the average of these two would yield a threshold value.

	Exercise 2 (without floodlight):
		(this time every measurement have the same lighting conditions, although still different surface types)
		red 	30
		blue	29
		grey	29
		white	32
		black	22
		l.green	30
		d.green	29

	Exercise 3 (with floodlight enabled):
		10ms: the robot follows the line with ease.
		100ms: still follows the line, although the robot has gotten tipsy.
		500ms: the robot zigzags so much it crashes into a wall, now drunk.
		1000ms: the robot can barely stand up, completely wasted.
		
		As the robot reacts slower, it cannot update in time to follow the line, and therefore it starts zigzagging

	Exercise 4:
		10ms: it oscillates roughly 3 times per second, 3Hz
		100ms: about 2Hz
		500ms: 0.5Hz
		1000ms: 0.2Hz
		Graphs made using GNUplot.
		
		As expected, making the robot react slower makes the light level oscillate slower as well.
		
	Exercise 5:

		Using variables:
			free memory slowly ticks down from 56k to 40k, then jumps back up to 56k
		Using strings directly:
			free memory quickly ticks down from 56k to 40k, then jumps back up to 56k
		
		With variable references, a reference is used in the method call every 10ms, whereas using strings directly handles each method call as a different input, and has to save all of them. This eats memory much faster.

Conclusion:
	All PCs now have bluetooth connectivity with the NXT, and all exercises have been solved.
