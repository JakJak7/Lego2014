\subsection{Today}

We started out by once again calibrating the robot as the lighting
conditions had changed since we left the previous day. We also attempted
to expand the method for replacing broken solar panels, so that we could
take fresh solar panels from the other two positions in the warehouse.
We did not get far in doing this, however, as a lot of people wanted to
use the track as it was the day of the presentations. Through the day we
continued to calibrate the robot to the ever-changing light conditions
before the final presentation. We also sped up the robot when passing by
solar panels to improve a bit more on our total run time.
