  Make the robot align with the line nicely so it may hit the solar
  panels correctly
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hitting the solar panels correctly}

By lowering the speed of the robot and using the tacho counter, it was
possible to make the robot align, and together with the P-controller,
the result came out quite good. We also moved the the color sensor a bit
further forward, so that the robot would not turn when it registered the
grey area under the solar panel. Our current problem is that when the
robot approaches the solar panel to pick it up, it will often
accidentally push the solar panel a bit forward, which means the robot
will not get a proper hold of the solar panel. Part of the goal for next
time will thus be to add LEGO to the robot that makes it possible for us
to make the robot get a hold of the solar panel correctly more
consistently.

\subsection{Results}

The result for today can be seen in the video below, which shows a
pretty standard run. \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuCP3WbW8g}
