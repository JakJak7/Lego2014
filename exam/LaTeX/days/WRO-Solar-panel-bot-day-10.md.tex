\subsection{Goals for today}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Make the robot align nicely so that it may hit the solar panels
  correctly
\item
  Create a testing program using hard coded values and experiment with
  this
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hitting the solar panels correctly}

\subsubsection{First idea from yesterday}

Driving back and forth to align the robot with the line we want to
follow. The first attempt at this idea from yesterday seemed to fail;
the width of the line was too big, so it was a bit random where the
robot ended up.

\subsubsection{Second idea}

After having turned, drive backwards so that the robot has a longer
linie to follow before the first solar panel. Use a P-controller to
follow the line, this should make the robot align nicely. We have
attempted doing this, and also driving backwards and forwards multiple
times, but it still seems that the robot doesn't align as precisely as
we want it to.

\subsubsection{Conclusion}

We continue to have problems aligning in a sufficiently accurate way
with the line, so we will start out the next session by continuing this
work.
